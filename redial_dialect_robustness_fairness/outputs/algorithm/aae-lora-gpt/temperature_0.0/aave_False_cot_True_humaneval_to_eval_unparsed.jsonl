When it encounters an open parenthesis, it adds it to the stack and to the temporary string. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it removes the top of the stack and adds it to the temporary string. If the stack is empty when it encounters a close parenthesis, it means that the current group of parentheses has been closed, so it adds the temporary string to the result list and resets the temporary string."}

For each operation, it adds the operation to the current balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns True. If it finishes iterating over the list without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns False."}

When it encounters an open parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack and increments the maximum level of nesting. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it pops the stack and decrements the maximum level of nesting. When it encounters a close parenthesis and the stack is empty, it means that the current group of parentheses has been closed, so it appends the maximum level of nesting to the result list and resets the maximum level of nesting to 0."}

When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns False because there is no corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty.

It then calculates the actual shift by taking the modulus of the shift with the length of the string. This ensures that the shift is within the range of the number of digits in the string. Finally, it returns the string with the digits shifted to the right by the calculated shift. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, the function will return the digits reversed."}

The `key` argument of the `sorted()` function is a function that takes a list element and returns a value that will be used for sorting purposes. In this case, the function `lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x)` is used. This function converts the integer `x` to a binary string using `bin(x)`, counts the number of '1's in the binary string using `count('1')`, and then returns a tuple where the first element is the count of '1's and the second element is the integer `x` itself. The `sorted()` function then sorts the array based on these tuples."}
