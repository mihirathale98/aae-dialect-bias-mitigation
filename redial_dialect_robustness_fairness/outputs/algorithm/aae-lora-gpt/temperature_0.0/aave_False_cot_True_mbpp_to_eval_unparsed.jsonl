For each index, it appends the elements from the three lists in order to the result list. The result is a list that contains all the elements from the input lists, in the order they appear in the input lists."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/102", "solution": "Here is a Python function that converts a snake case string to a camel case string:\n\n```Python\ndef snake_to_camel(s):\n    return ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split('_'))\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string into words using the underscore as a delimiter, capitalizing each word, and then joining the words back together. The result is a camel case string."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/297", "solution": "Here is a Python function that flattens a given nested list structure:\n\n```Python\ndef flatten_list(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if type(i) == list:\n            result.extend(flatten_list(i))\n        else:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list. If the element is a list itself, it calls itself with that list as the argument. If the element is not a list, it simply adds it to the result list. This way, the function can handle any level of nesting in the list."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/765", "solution": "Here is a Python function that generates the nth polite number:\n\n```Python\ndef is_polite(n):\n    polite_numbers = []\n    i = 0\n    while len(polite_numbers) < n:\n        i += 1\n        polite_numbers.append(i * (3 * i - 1) // 2)\n    return polite_numbers[-1]\n```\n\nThis function starts by initializing an empty list called `polite_numbers`. It then enters a loop that continues until the list contains `n` polite numbers. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the next polite number by multiplying `i` by `(3 * i - 1) // 2`, and then adds this number to the list. Finally, it returns the last polite number in the list, which is the `n`th polite number."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/290", "solution": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```Python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        if len(lst) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n    return (max_length, max_list)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each list in the list of lists. If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, it updates the maximum length and the maximum list. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the maximum list."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/113", "solution": "Here is a Python function that checks if a string represents an integer or not:\n\n```Python\ndef check_integer(s):\n    try:\n        int(s)\n        return True\n    except ValueError:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function works by trying to convert the string to an integer. If the conversion is successful, the function returns True. If the conversion fails (which would happen if the string does not represent an integer), the function returns False."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/758", "solution": "Here is a Python function that counts the occurrences of lists within a list:\n\n```Python\ndef unique_sublists(lst):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        item_tuple = tuple(sorted(item))\n        if item_tuple in count_dict:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] = 1\n    return count_dict\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each item in the list. It converts each item to a tuple (to ensure that the order of elements in the list does not matter) and checks if this tuple is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count for this tuple; if not, it adds the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/767", "solution": "Here is a Python function that counts the number of pairs whose sum is equal to 'sum'. The function takes as input a list of numbers and the sum.\n\n```Python\ndef get_pairs_count(lst, sum):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            if lst[i] + lst[j] == sum:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list and checking each pair of numbers to see if their sum is equal to the given sum. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/608", "solution": "Here is a Python function to find the nth Bell number:\n\n```Python\ndef bell_Number(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return sum([bell_Number(i) * bell_Number(n - i - 1) for i in range(n)])\n```\n\nThis function uses recursion to calculate the nth Bell number. The Bell number is calculated as the sum of the product of the Bell numbers of all smaller numbers."}

It iterates over the list, and for each item, it pairs it with the next item in the list. The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of consecutive items from the original list."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/723", "solution": "Here is a Python function that counts the indices where the lists have the same values:\n\n```Python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    return sum(1 for i in range(len(list1)) if list1[i] == list2[i])\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the indices of the lists and counting the number of indices where the values are the same. The sum function is used to count the number of indices where the values are the same."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/641", "solution": "Here is a Python function that calculates the nth nonagonal number:\n\n```Python\ndef is_nonagonal(n):\n    return (n * (n * 3 - 1)) // 2\n```\n\nThis function works by using the formula for the nth nonagonal number, which is n * (n * 3 - 1) / 2. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding nonagonal number."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/286", "solution": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```Python\ndef max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, k, n):\n    arr = arr * k\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis function first creates a new array by repeating the given array k times. It then initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum sum and another variable to keep track of the current sum. It then iterates over the array, adding each element to the current sum. If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum. If the current sum is less than 0, it resets the current sum to 0. Finally, it returns the maximum sum."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/476", "solution": "Here is a Python function that finds the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array:\n\n```Python\ndef big_sum(arr):\n    return max(arr) + min(arr)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in Python functions max() and min() to find the largest and smallest values in the array, and then adding them together."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/790", "solution": "Here is a Python function that checks whether every even index contains even numbers of a given list:\n\n```Python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list in steps of 2 (i.e., it checks every even index). If it finds an index where the number is not even, it immediately returns False. If it checks all the even indices and doesn't find any odd numbers, it returns True."}
