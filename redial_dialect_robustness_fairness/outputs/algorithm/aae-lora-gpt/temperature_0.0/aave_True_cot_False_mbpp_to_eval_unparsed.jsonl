It checks if the length of the patterns list is equal to the length of the sequence. If they are not equal, it returns False. Then, it iterates over the patterns and sequence lists.

If it is, it replaces the first occurrence of `c` with an empty string, effectively removing it. Then, it removes any trailing occurrences of `c` using the `rstrip` method. Finally, it returns the modified string."}

In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, if the tuple has any duplicates, the set will have fewer elements than the tuple, and the function will return True. If the tuple has no duplicates, the set will have the same number of elements as the tuple, and the function will return False."}

{"task_id": "Mbpp/286", "solution": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```Python\ndef max_sum_repeated_k_times(arr, k, n):\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        temp_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, len(arr)):\n            temp_sum += arr[j]\n            if j - i + 1 == n:\n                max_sum = max(max_sum, temp_sum)\n    return max_sum * k\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the array and calculating the sum of each subarray of length `n`. It keeps track of the maximum sum found so far and returns `k` times this maximum sum."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/476", "solution": "Here is a Python function that calculates the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array:\n\n```Python\ndef big_sum(arr):\n    return max(arr) + min(arr)\n```\n\nThis function works by using the built-in Python functions `max()` and `min()` to find the largest and smallest values in the array, and then adding them together."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/790", "solution": "Here is a Python function that checks if every even index has an even number in a given list:\n\n```Python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list in steps of 2 (i.e., it checks every even index). If it finds an index with an odd number, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all the even indices and doesn't find any odd numbers, it returns `True`."}
