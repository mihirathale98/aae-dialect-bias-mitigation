When it encounters an open parenthesis, it adds it to the stack and to the temporary string. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it removes the top of the stack and adds it to the temporary string. If the stack is empty when it encounters a close parenthesis, it means that the current group of parentheses has been closed, so it adds the temporary string to the result list and resets the temporary string."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/2", "solution": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```Python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    return number - int(number)\n```\n\nThis function works by subtracting the integer part of the number from the number itself. The integer part of a number is the largest integer smaller than the number. This is achieved by using the built-in int() function in Python, which returns the integer part of a number."}

For each operation, it adds the operation to the current balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns True. If it finishes iterating over the list without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns False."}

The sum of these differences is then divided by the number of elements in the list to get the Mean Absolute Deviation."}

When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decrements the maximum level of nesting. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increments the maximum level of nesting. When it encounters a closing parenthesis and the stack is empty, it means that the current group of parentheses has been closed, so it adds the maximum level of nesting to the result list and resets the maximum level of nesting to 0."}

If it is, it returns a tuple of 0 and 1. If the list is not empty, it uses the reduce function from the functools module to calculate the sum and product of the list. The reduce function applies a function to all items in an iterable, going from left to right, so for the sum it adds all the numbers together, and for the product it multiplies all the numbers together."}

It repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` becomes 0. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the GCD is always positive."}

It then sorts this list based on the index of each string in the list `['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']`. Finally, it joins the sorted list back into a string with spaces in between each number."}

Then, it applies a linear transformation to each number in the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This ensures that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1."}

It then uses the built-in sum function to calculate the sum of these squares. The isinstance function is used to ensure that the numbers in the list are integers, and the if condition is used to ensure that the numbers are positive. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0."}

It then iterates over each character in the string, which represents a digit in the number. It checks if the digit is even or odd by using the modulus operator. If the remainder of the division of the digit by 2 is 0, then the digit is even. If the remainder is 1, then the digit is odd. It then increments the appropriate counter (even or odd) and finally returns a tuple of the counts."}

It then subtracts the value from the number and moves on to the next value. This process continues until the number becomes 0. The result is then converted to lowercase and returned."}

If the sides can form a triangle, it then checks if the sides can form a right-angled triangle by checking if the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to the square of the third side.

For each word, it calculates the number of unique characters by converting the word to a set (which removes duplicates) and then calculates the length of the set. If the number of unique characters is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum and the corresponding word. If the number of unique characters is equal to the current maximum, it checks if the current word is lexicographically smaller than the current maximum word and updates the maximum word if it is. Finally, it returns the maximum word."}

If the total number of carrots needed is greater than the remaining carrots, it returns a list with the total number of carrots eaten and 0 remaining carrots. If the total number of carrots needed is less than or equal to the remaining carrots, it returns a list with the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after the rabbit has eaten the needed number of carrots."}
