{"task_id": "Mbpp/297", "solution": "Here is a Python function that flattens a given nested list structure:\n\n```Python\ndef flatten_list(lst):\n    result = []\n    for i in lst:\n        if type(i) == list:\n            result.extend(flatten_list(i))\n        else:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each element in the list. If the element is a list itself, it calls itself with that list as the argument. If the element is not a list, it simply adds it to the result list. This way, the function can handle any level of nesting in the list."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/765", "solution": "Here is a Python function to find the nth polite number:\n\n```Python\ndef is_polite(n):\n    polite_numbers = []\n    i = 0\n    while len(polite_numbers) < n:\n        i += 1\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            if i % j == 0:\n                polite_numbers.append(i)\n                break\n    return polite_numbers[-1]\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to infinity, and for each number, it checks if it is a polite number by checking if it is divisible by any number less than or equal to itself. If it is, it adds it to the list of polite numbers. Once it has found the nth polite number, it returns that number."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/290", "solution": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```Python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        if len(lst) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n    return (max_length, max_list)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each list in the list of lists. If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, it updates the maximum length and the maximum list. Finally, it returns the maximum length and the maximum list."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/113", "solution": "Here is a Python function that checks if a string represents an integer or not:\n\n```Python\ndef check_integer(s):\n    try:\n        int(s)\n        return True\n    except ValueError:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function works by trying to convert the string to an integer. If the conversion is successful, the function returns True. If the conversion fails (which would happen if the string does not represent an integer), the function returns False."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/758", "solution": "Here is a Python function that counts the occurrences of lists within a list:\n\n```Python\ndef unique_sublists(lst):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        item_tuple = tuple(sorted(item))\n        if item_tuple in count_dict:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] = 1\n    return count_dict\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each item in the list. It converts each item to a tuple and sorts the tuple to ensure that the same list is always represented by the same tuple. It then checks if the tuple is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count for that tuple. If it is not, it adds the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/767", "solution": "Here is a Python function that counts the number of pairs whose sum is equal to 'sum'. The function takes as input a list of numbers and the sum.\n\n```Python\ndef get_pairs_count(lst, sum):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            if lst[i] + lst[j] == sum:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over the list and checking each pair of numbers to see if their sum is equal to the given sum. If it is, it increments the count. The function then returns the count."}

The `math.comb` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient."}

It iterates over the list, and for each item, it pairs it with the next item in the list. The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of consecutive items from the original list."}

The sum function is used to count the number of indices where the values are the same."}

The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth nonagonal number."}

It then initializes a variable to keep track of the maximum sum and another variable to keep track of the current sum. It then iterates over the array, adding each element to the current sum. If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum. If the current sum is less than 0, it resets the current sum to 0. Finally, it returns the maximum sum."}

If it finds an index where the number is not even, it immediately returns False. If it checks all the even indices and finds that they all contain even numbers, it returns True."}
