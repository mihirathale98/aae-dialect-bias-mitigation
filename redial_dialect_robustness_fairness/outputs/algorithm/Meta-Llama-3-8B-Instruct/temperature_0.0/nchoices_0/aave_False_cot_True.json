We iterate through the list of numbers using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each number in the list, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining numbers in the list, starting from the next index.\n2. For each pair of numbers, we calculate the absolute difference between them using the `abs` function.\n3. If the absolute difference is less than the given threshold, we immediately return `True`, indicating that we found two numbers closer to each other than the threshold.\n4.

We initialize an empty stack, an empty result list, and an empty temporary string `temp`.\n2. We iterate through each character in the input string. If the character is a space, we skip it.\n3.

We import the necessary types from the `typing` module: `List` and `Optional`.\n2. We define the `python_function` function, which takes a list of strings as input and returns an optional string.\n3. We check if the input list is empty using the `not` operator. If it is, we return `None`.\n4.

The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The `while` loop continues until `b` is 0.\n3. In each iteration, we swap the values of `a` and `b`, and then calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b` using the modulo operator (`%`). This is the key step in the Euclidean algorithm.\n4. When `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.\n5.

The `join` method takes an iterable of strings as an argument and returns a single string with the elements of the iterable separated by the string on which it is called (in this case, a space).\n\nYou can test the function with the examples you provided:\n```\nprint(python_function(0))  # Output: '0'\nprint(python_function(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n```\nI hope this helps!

For each pair of adjacent numbers, we calculate the difference between them (`diff`).\n4. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, we update the minimum difference and the closest pair.\n5. Finally, we return the closest pair.\n\nYou can test the function using the examples you provided:\n```\nprint(python_function([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # (2.0, 2.2)\nprint(python_function([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # (2.0, 2.0)\n```\nI hope this helps!

The function `python_function` takes a list `xs` of coefficients as input.\n2. It checks if `xs` has an even number of coefficients and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n3. It checks if the largest non-zero coefficient is non-zero and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n4. It defines a helper function `poly` to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`.\n5. It uses Newton's method to find the root of the polynomial. The initial guess is set to 1.0, and the tolerance is set to 1e-6. The maximum number of iterations is set to 100.\n6. The function iterates until the absolute difference between the current estimate and the previous estimate is less than the tolerance, or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n7. If the function converges, it returns the root rounded to 2 decimal places. Otherwise, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nYou can test the function using the examples you provided:\n```\nprint(round(python_function([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x\nprint(round(python_function([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3\n```",

If `n` is 1, we return 1, as the first Fibonacci number is 1.\n3. If `n` is 2, we also return 1, as the second Fibonacci number is also 1.\n4. For `n` greater than 2, we use a loop to calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number. We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 1, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n5. In each iteration of the loop, we update `a` and `b` to the next two Fibonacci numbers by setting `a` to `b` and `b` to the sum of `a` and `b`.

If it is, the function returns `-1` as per the problem statement.\n2. `average = round(sum(range(n, m+1)) / (m - n + 1))`: This calculates the average of the integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive) by summing them up using the `sum` function and the `range` function, and then dividing by the number of integers (`m - n + 1`).

Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the count of numbers that meet the conditions.\n2. Iterate through each number `num` in the input array `nums`.\n3. Check if the absolute value of `num` is greater than 10. This is because the problem statement asks for numbers greater than 10.\n4. Convert `num` to a string using `str(num)`. This allows us to access the first and last digits of the number.\n5. Check if the first digit of the number (i.e., `str(num)[0]`) is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the digit is even; otherwise, it's odd.\n6. Check if the last digit of the number (i.e., `str(num)[-1]`) is odd using the same modulo operator.\n7. If both conditions are true (i.e., the number is greater than 10 and both first and last digits are odd), increment the `count` variable.\n8.

This will give us a list of substrings, where each substring is either a quoted string or an empty string (if there are consecutive quotation marks).\n2. `[x.strip('\"') for x in...]`: This is a list comprehension that iterates over the list of substrings obtained in step 1. For each substring `x`, we use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing quotation marks (`\"`) from the substring. This ensures that we get the actual quoted string without the surrounding quotation marks.\n3. `if x.strip('\"')`: This is a filter that checks whether the resulting substring after stripping the quotation marks is not empty. If it is empty, it means that the original substring was just an empty string (i.e., consecutive quotation marks), so we skip it.\n\nThe resulting list comprehension returns a list of quoted strings, where each string has been stripped of its surrounding quotation marks.\n\nLet's test the function with the given example:\n```\nassert python_function('Cortex \"A53\" Based \"multi\" tasking \"Processor\"') == ['A53','multi', 'Processor']\n```\nThis should pass, indicating that the function is working correctly!",

If it finds a character that is different from the previous one, it returns False, indicating that the number is not undulating. If it checks all characters and doesn't find any differences, it returns True, indicating that the number is undulating.\n\nThe unit test `assert python_function(1212121) == True` ensures that the function works correctly for the given example.",

The function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 10. This is because the first digit of a number is the leftmost digit, which is the digit that is not affected by the division by 10.\n3. Inside the loop, we use the integer division operator `//` to divide `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of the number.\n4. Once the loop exits, `n` is the first digit of the original number.\n5. The function returns the value of `n`.\n\nThe unit test `assert python_function(123) == 1` confirms that the function works correctly.\n\nYou can test the function with other inputs to verify its correctness.

We iterate over the items in the `students` dictionary using the `.items()` method, which returns an iterator over the key-value pairs.\n2. For each item, we check if the height (`height_weight[0]`) is greater than the minimum height (`min_height`) and if the weight (`height_weight[1]`) is greater than the minimum weight (`min_weight`). We use the `and` operator to combine these two conditions.\n3. If both conditions are true, we include the student's name and height-weight tuple in the resulting dictionary.\n4. We use a dictionary comprehension to create the resulting dictionary, which contains only the students who meet the height and weight criteria.\n\nThe unit test you provided, `assert python_function({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)},6.0,70)=={'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}`, confirms that the function works correctly.",

We use list comprehension to create two lists: `first_elements` and `second_elements`.

The function takes the input list `[['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]`, extracts the first elements (`'x'`, `'a'`, `'m'`) and the second elements (`'y'`, `'b'`, `'n'`), and returns the resulting lists `['x', 'a','m']` and `['y', 'b', 'n']`.",

This is because we need to check if the small list is a sublist of the big list, and we can't start checking from the middle of the big list.\n2. For each index `i`, we slice the big list from `i` to `i+len(small_list)` to get a sublist of the same length as the small list.\n3.

We split the input string `s` into components using the `_` character as a separator. This gives us a list of words.\n2. We take the first component and leave it as is.\n3. We iterate over the remaining components and capitalize each one using the `title()` method. This converts the first letter of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n4.

We iterate over the list using a for loop, but we only consider the even indices by starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 each time (`range(0, len(lst), 2)`).\n2. For each even index `i`, we check if the value at that index is even by using the modulo operator (`lst[i] % 2!= 0`). If the value is odd, we immediately return `False`.\n3. If we reach the end of the loop without returning `False`, it means that every even index contains an even number, so we return `True`.\n\nThe unit test `assert python_function([3,2,1]) == False` helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return `False` when there is at least one odd number at an even index.\n\nYou can test the function with other examples to verify its correctness.",
