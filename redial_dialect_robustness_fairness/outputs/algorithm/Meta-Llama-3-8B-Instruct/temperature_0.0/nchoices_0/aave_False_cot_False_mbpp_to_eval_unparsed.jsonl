We create an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each item in the list.\n2. We iterate through the list, and for each item, we check if it's already in the `freq` dictionary.

The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1, indicating that the list contains only one distinct element, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe unit test `assert unique_Element([1,1,1]) == True` passes because the function correctly returns `True` for a list with only one distinct element.\n\nYou can test the function with other examples, such as:\n```\nprint(unique_Element([1, 2, 3]))  # False\nprint(unique_Element([1, 1, 1]))  # True\nprint(unique_Element([1, 2, 2]))  # False\n```"}

The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. The generator expression `lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1)` checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list. If the list is sorted, this expression will be true for all elements, and the `all` function will return `True`. If the list is not sorted, the `all` function will return `False`.\n\nThe unit test `assert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True` ensures that the function correctly identifies a sorted list."}

We use a `try`-`except` block to catch any `ValueError` exceptions that might occur when trying to convert the string to a float. If the conversion fails, we return `False`.\n2. We split the input string into two parts using the `.` character as a separator. If the string doesn't contain a decimal point, `parts` will be a list with only one element, and we return `False`.\n3. We check if the length of the second part (i.e., the fractional part) is greater than 2. If it is, we return `False`, since the precision is not 2.\n4.

The function takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n2. The `sum` function is used to count the number of equal numbers.\n3. The generator expression `(a, b, c)` creates a sequence of the three input numbers.\n4. The `if x == a` condition checks if each number is equal to `a`.

We create an empty dictionary `aggregate_dict` to store the aggregate scores for each name.\n2. We iterate through the list of tuples.

We try to convert the input string `s` to an integer using the `int()` function.\n2. If the conversion is successful, it means the string represents an integer, so we return `True`.\n3. If the conversion fails (i.e., a `ValueError` is raised), it means the string does not represent an integer, so we return `False`.\n\nThe unit test `assert check_integer(\"python\")==False` passes because the string \"python\" is not an integer, so the function returns `False`.\n\nYou can test the function with other examples, such as:\n```\nprint(check_integer(\"123\"))  # True\nprint(check_integer(\"abc\"))  # False\nprint(check_integer(\"123.45\"))  # False\nprint(check_integer(\"hello\"))  # False\n```"}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/758", "solution": "Here is the Python function that solves the problem:\n```\ndef unique_sublists(lst):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for item in lst:\n        item_tuple = tuple(item)\n        if item_tuple in count_dict:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[item_tuple] = 1\n    return count_dict\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. We initialize an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each tuple.\n2. We iterate through the input list `lst`.\n3. For each item in the list, we convert it to a tuple using the `tuple()` function.\n4. We check if the tuple is already in the `count_dict`. If it is, we increment its count by 1. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n5. Finally, we return the `count_dict`.\n\nThe unit test you provided:\n```\nassert unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]) == {(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}\n```\nshould pass with this implementation."}

If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.\n\nThe unit test `assert get_pairs_count([1,1,1,1],2) == 6` suggests that the function should return 6 for the input `[1,1,1,1]` and `sum=2`, which is correct because there are 6 pairs of elements that add up to 2: `(1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1)`.\n\nYou can also use a dictionary to store the frequency of each number in the list and then calculate the count of pairs. Here is an example:\n```\ndef get_pairs_count(lst, sum):\n    freq = {}\n    count = 0\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in freq:\n            freq[num] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[num] = 1\n    for num in freq:\n        if sum - num in freq:\n            count += freq[num] * freq[sum - num]\n    return count\n```\nThis function first builds a dictionary `freq` that stores the frequency of each number in the list. Then it iterates over the dictionary and for each number, it checks if its complement (i.e. the number that would add up to the given sum) is also in the dictionary. If it is, it calculates the count of pairs by multiplying the frequencies of the two numbers. Finally, it returns the count."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/608", "solution": "The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that arise in combinatorial mathematics. They are named after Eric Temple Bell, who wrote about them in his 1938 book \"Men of Mathematics\". The nth Bell number, denoted by Bn, is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.\n\nHere is a Python function to find the nth Bell number:\n\n```Python\ndef bell_Number(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        bell_numbers = [1, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            bell_numbers.append(sum([bell_numbers[j] * math.comb(i-1, j) for j in range(i)]))\n        return bell_numbers[n]\n```\n\nThis function uses dynamic programming to calculate the Bell numbers. It starts with the base cases B0 = B1 = 1, and then iteratively calculates the Bell numbers for larger n. The formula for the nth Bell number is the sum of the Bell numbers for the previous numbers, multiplied by the number of ways to choose that number of parts. The `math.comb` function is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a number of parts.\n\nThe unit test `assert bell_Number(2) == 2` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the second Bell number, which is 2."}

This effectively pairs each element in the original list with the next element in the list.\n* The list comprehension `[...]` is used to convert the iterator returned by `zip` into a list of tuples.\n\nThe unit test you provided, `assert pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5]) == [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]`, confirms that the function works as expected."}
