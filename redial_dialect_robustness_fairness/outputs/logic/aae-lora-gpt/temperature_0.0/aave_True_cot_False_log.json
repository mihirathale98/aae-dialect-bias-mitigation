These majestic creatures often find themselves in zoos, where crowds gather to gawk at their towering heights.

Despite their long necks and lofty stature, these gentle giants dig the open plains, basking in that warm sun and feasting on those sweet acacia leaves. So, while many tall critters find a home in the zoo, it's the free-spirited giraffes that remind us there's a whole wild world out there where they can truly shine and thrive.
