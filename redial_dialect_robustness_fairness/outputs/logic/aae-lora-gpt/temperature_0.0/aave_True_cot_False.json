These majestic creatures, with their striking black and white coats, moved the countryside in peaceful herds. In this world, it was well known that black and white animals liked stayin' in groups, findin' safety and companionship in numbers. But in all that togetherness, one black and white animal stood out from the crowd, doin' it's own thing, preferrin' to be alone instead of hangin' with the herd. And so, while the rest of the cows stuck together, this one found peace in bein' independent. That mean cows don't usually stay in groups?
