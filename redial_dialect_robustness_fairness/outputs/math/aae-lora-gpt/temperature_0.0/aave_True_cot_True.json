There are 8 packs of chocolate bars, and each pack has 5 chocolate bars, so we multiply 8 x 5 = 40 chocolate bars.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many chocolate bars each adult will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so we multiply 4 x 6 = 24 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left over for the kids. We subtract the number of chocolate bars each adult gets from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nFinally, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 kids. We divide 16 by 8, which gives us 2 chocolate bars per kid.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>2</answer>"

        "response": [
            "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. Since he turns 27 in 5 years, he will be 27 + 5 = 32 years old in 8 years.\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, we can set up the equation:\n\nCousin's age in 8 years = 2 x Jame's age in 8 years - 5\n\nSubstituting Jame's age in 8 years (32), we get:\n\nCousin's age in 8 years = 2 x 32 - 5\n= 64 - 5\n= 59\n\nSo, Jame's cousin will be 59 years old in 8 years.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many years there are between Jame's age and his cousin's age. Since Jame is currently 27 years old, and his cousin will be 59 years old in 8 years, we can subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age to get:\n\n59 - 27 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 years between Jame's age and his cousin's age.\n\nFinally, we need to simplify the answer and wrap it up inside the <answer> tags.

He paid the transfer fees of about 3% the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that's 5% the selling price. How much Mr. Tan's gon make from selling the crib if he also paid 250 grand for the remaining loan amount on the crib?\nAnswer:",
        "response": [
            "Let's break it down step by step. First, we need to calculate the transfer fees and brokerage fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is 3% of $400,000, or $12,000. The brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, which is 5% of $400,000, or $20,000. So the total fees are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. Now, we need to subtract the fees from the selling price to get the amount Mr. Tan will make from selling the crib. $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. Finally, we need to subtract the remaining loan amount from the amount Mr. Tan will make. $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000. So Mr. Tan will make $118,000 from selling the crib."

He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. How much money is he gon' lose if, after investing all his cash in the rock stand, all he sold was 60% of his inventory?\nAnswer:",
        "response": [
            "Let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide $100 by $5 to get the number of rocks he can buy. $100 / $5 = 20 rocks.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Adam will make from selling the rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, we can multiply the number of rocks he sells by $7 to get the total amount of money he makes. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we can multiply 20 rocks by 0.6 to get the number of rocks he sells. 20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks.\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Adam makes from selling the rocks. 12 rocks x $7 = $84.\n\nFinally, we can find out how much money Adam loses. He spends $100 to buy the rocks, but he only makes $84 from selling them. So, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>$16</answer>."

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n2200 + 2m = 2800\n\nSubtracting 2200 from both sides, we get:\n\n2m = 600\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nm = 300\n\nSo, one monitor cost $300.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>300</answer>"

Then, she still needs to add 6 - x cups of sugar.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary has to add. She needs to add 7 cups of flour and 6 - x cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she has to add, we need to subtract the number of cups of sugar she has to add from the number of cups of flour she has to add. So, we get:\n\n7 - (6 - x) = ?\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n7 - 6 + x = ?\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 + x = ?\n\nSo, Mary has to add 1 + x cups of sugar more than cups of flour."

How many more kids you reckon she played with on Monday than on Tuesday if she spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days?\nAnswer:",
        "response": [
            "Let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find the difference in the number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday. So, 19 - 18 = 1. This means Julia played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of hours Julia spent playing tag on both days. We know that she spent a total of 38 hours, and we know that she spent the same number of hours on both days. So, we can divide the total number of hours by 2 to find the number of hours she spent on each day. 38 / 2 = 19.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the number of hours Julia spent on each day by the number of kids she played with on each day to find the total number of hours she spent playing tag with each kid. So, 19 hours x 19 kids = 361 hours, and 19 hours x 18 kids = 342 hours. This means that Julia spent a total of 361 + 342 = 703 hours playing tag with all the kids.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>1</answer>."

Let's call the number of chocolate bars he bought \"x\". Then, we can write the equation:\n\n3x = ?\n\nSince Dan has $5, we know that the total amount he spent on chocolate bars and candy bars is $5. We can write the equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 5\n\nwhere y is the number of candy bars he bought. We can simplify the equation by subtracting 2y from both sides:\n\n3x = 5 - 2y\n\nNow, we can solve for x. Since each chocolate bar costs $3, we know that x must be an integer. Let's try x = 1. Then, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation:\n\n3(1) = 5 - 2y\n\n3 = 5 - 2y\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives us:\n\n0 = 2y - 2\n\nAdding 2 to both sides gives us:\n\n2 = 2y\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n1 = y\n\nSo, Dan bought 1 candy bar.

            "Let's break it down step by step!\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. We know that they harvest 16 sacks per day, so we can divide 80 by 16 to get the number of days:\n\n80 \u00f7 16 = 5\n\nSo it will take 5 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in each sack. We know that each sack has 57 oranges, so we can multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges per sack to get the total number of oranges:\n\n80 x 57 = 4560\n\nSo there are 4560 oranges in total.\n\n3.

Since he's building snowballs for 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many hours it will take him to build 60 snowballs.\n\n60 snowballs / 20 snowballs per hour = 3 hours\n\nNow, we need to account for the 2 snowballs that melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many times the snowballs melt in an hour:\n\n60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 times\n\nSo, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times.

Since the younger kid is 4 years younger, the age difference is 12 - 4 = 8 years.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find the number of packs needed.\n\nLet's assume the 12-year-old kid needs x candles and the 8-year-old kid needs y candles. Since the total number of candles needed is the sum of x and y, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + y = 16\n\nSince the 12-year-old kid needs more candles, we can assume x is greater than y. Let's say x = 10 and y = 6. This means the 12-year-old kid needs 10 candles and the 8-year-old kid needs 6 candles.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of candles needed:\n\nx + y = 10 + 6 = 16\n\nSince each pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find the number of packs needed:\n\n16 \u00f7 5 = 3.2\n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Since he gives 8 pieces of mail to each house in a block, and there are 32 pieces of mail per block, we can divide 32 by 8 to get the number of houses in a block:\n\n32 \u00f7 8 = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 houses in a block.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many blocks the mailman gives mail to. Since he gives 32 pieces of mail to each block, and there are 55 blocks, we can multiply 32 by 55 to get the total number of pieces of mail:\n\n32 x 55 = 1760\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of pieces of mail by the number of houses in a block to get the total number of houses:\n\n1760 \u00f7 4 = 440\n\nSo, there are 440 houses in total.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>440</answer>"

How many more girls than boys has the school got if 403 more girls joined the school?\nAnswer:",
        "response": [

This means that the school has 105 fewer boys than girls.\n\nNext, we need to find the difference between the number of girls in the school after the 403 more girls joined and the number of girls in the school before the 403 more girls joined. We can do this by adding the 403 more girls to the original number of girls. So, 257 + 403 = 660. This means that the school now has 660 girls.\n\nFinally, we can find the difference between the number of girls in the school after the 403 more girls joined and the number of boys in the school.
