                        "content": "Let's start by using the information that Rory picked up 19 tennis balls in total. We can set up an equation to represent the number of balls he picked up in each set:\n\nx + (x - 4) + (x - 2) = 19\n\nwhere x is the number of balls he picked up in the second set. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x - 6 = 19\n\nAdding 6 to both sides, we get:\n\n3x = 25\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 8\n\nSo Rory picked up 8 tennis balls in the second set. Since he picked up 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, he picked up 8 + 4 = 12 balls in the first set. Since he picked up half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, he picked up 8 / 2 = 4 balls in the third set.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>12</answer>",

Since the third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, the third child is 8 - 5 = 3 feet tall. Since the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, the fourth child is 3 + 3 = 6 feet tall.

Since a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and each pepper costs $15, then a watermelon costs $15 x 3 = $45.

The total cost of the peppers is 20 x $15 = $300. The total cost of the oranges is 10 x $40 = $400. The total cost of all the items is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.\n\nSo, Dillon will need to spend $880.",

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to rats is 3 x 6 = 18. Hamsters get 5 pieces of straw each, and there are 10 cages of hamsters. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50. Rabbits get 20 pieces of straw. The total number of pieces of straw given to all rodents is 160. So, the number of pieces of straw given to rats and hamsters is 160 - 20 = 140. Since rats get 18 pieces of straw, the number of rats in each cage is 18 / 6 = 3. Since hamsters get 50 pieces of straw, the number of hamsters is 50 / 5 = 10. Since there are 3 cages of rats and 10 cages of hamsters, the number of rats in each cage is 3.",

We can do this by multiplying the average speed by the number of hours he would have traveled in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael would have traveled for 3 x 24 = 72 hours. The total distance he would have covered is then 50 km/h x 72 hours = 3600 km. To find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that he would have covered, we can divide the distance he would have covered by the total distance and multiply by 100. This gives us (3600 km / 6000 km) x 100 = 60%. So, Michael would have covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days.",

Since Frances invested two-thirds of the remaining amount, we can find Frances' investment by subtracting Dylan's investment from the total amount:\n\nRemaining amount = 1200 - 480\n= 720\n\nFrances' investment = 2/3 * 720\n= 480\n\nThis means that Frances' investment is also $480.

                        "content": "Let's solve the problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we can divide $100 by $5 to get the number of rocks he can buy: $100 / $5 = 20 rocks.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Adam will make by selling 60% of his inventory. Since he has 20 rocks, 60% of his inventory is 0.6 x 20 = 12 rocks. Each rock sells for $7, so he will make 12 x $7 = $84.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much money Adam will lose. He invested $100 in the rock stand, and he made $84 by selling 60% of his inventory. To find out how much money he lost, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he invested: $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nSo, Adam will lose $16 if he sells 60% of his inventory.",

Since Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, we can find Dean's height by subtracting 6 from 15:\n\nDean's height = 15 - 6 = 9 feet\n\nNow, we know that the water's depth is 9 times the height of Dean. So, we can multiply Dean's height by 9:\n\nWater's depth = 9 x 9 = 81 feet\n\nSo, the water's depth is 81 feet.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>81</answer>",
