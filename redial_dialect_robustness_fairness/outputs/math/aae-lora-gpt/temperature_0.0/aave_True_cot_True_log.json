So, we can set up an equation:\n\nAlex's weight = 4 x Grace's weight - 2\n\nWe know that Grace weighs 125 pounds, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\nAlex's weight = 4 x 125 - 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nAlex's weight = 500 - 2\n\nAlex's weight = 498\n\nSo, Alex weighs 498 pounds.\n\nNow, we need to find the total weight of both Grace and Alex. We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds, and Alex weighs 498 pounds. To find the total weight, we can add the two weights together:\n\nTotal weight = 125 + 498\n\nTotal weight = 623\n\nSo, the total weight of both Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.\n\nHere's the answer wrapped up in the correct format:\n\n<answer>623</answer>",

Total gingerbread sales: $60 + $90 = $150.\n\nApple Pie: 6 boxes on Saturday (10 - 4) x $15 = $90, and 21 boxes on Sunday (14 + 15) x $15 = $315.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so we multiply 4 x 6 = 24 chocolate bars.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are left over for the kids. We subtract the number of chocolate bars each adult gets from the total number of chocolate bars: 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars.\n\nFinally, we need to divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 kids.

Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, we can multiply 15 kg/hour by 10 hours to get:\n\n15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day\n\nNow, we know that Prince needs to sell 750 kg of meat from the bull. To find out how many days it will take him to sell this amount, we can divide 750 kg by the amount he sells in a day:\n\n750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days\n\nSo, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the 750 kg of meat from the bull.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>5</answer>",

Since each camel has 2 humps, the total number of humps on camels is 2x.\n\nLet's say the number of dromedaries is y. Since each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of humps on dromedaries is y.\n\nWe know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can set up the equation: x + y = 180.\n\nWe also know that the total number of humps is 304, so we can set up the equation: 2x + y = 304.\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: x = 124.\n\nNow we can substitute x into the first equation to find y: y = 180 - 124 = 56.\n\nSo, the number of dromedaries is 56.\n\nAnswer: <answer>56</answer>",

We can do this by multiplying the average speed by the number of hours he would have traveled in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Michael would have traveled for 3 x 24 = 72 hours. So, the total distance he would have covered is:\n\n50 km/h x 72 hours = 3600 km\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael would have covered. We can do this by dividing the distance he would have covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas, and then multiplying by 100:\n\n(3600 km / 6000 km) x 100 = 60%\n\nSo, Michael would have covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas if he keeps up with his average speed for 3 days.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>60%</answer>",

Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can multiply the number of grams of mushrooms by the number of grams of protein per cup:\n\n200 grams of mushrooms/day x 3 grams of protein/cup = 600 grams of protein/day\n\nNext, we need to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of grams of protein per day by 7:\n\n600 grams of protein/day x 7 days/week = 4200 grams of protein/week\n\nFinally, we can simplify the answer by wrapping it up inside the <answer> tags:\n\n<answer>4200</answer>",

Since he turns 27 in 5 years, he will be 27 + 5 = 32 years old in 8 years.\n\nNext, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, we can set up the equation:\n\nCousin's age in 8 years = 2 x Jame's age in 8 years - 5\n\nSubstituting Jame's age in 8 years (32), we get:\n\nCousin's age in 8 years = 2 x 32 - 5\n= 64 - 5\n= 59\n\nSo, Jame's cousin will be 59 years old in 8 years.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many years there are between Jame's age and his cousin's age. Since Jame is currently 27 years old, and his cousin will be 59 years old in 8 years, we can subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age to get:\n\n59 - 27 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 years between Jame's age and his cousin's age.\n\nFinally, we need to simplify the answer and wrap it up inside the <answer> tags.

Since the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, the number of worker bees is 2x.\n\nSince the number of queens is half the number of baby bees, the number of queens is x/2.\n\nThe total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 2x + x/2 = 700\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4.5x = 700\n\nDivide both sides by 4.5:\n\nx = 155.56\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a bee, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, the number of baby bees is 156.\n\nNow, we can find the number of worker bees:\n\nWorker bees = 2x = 2(156) = 312\n\nSo, there are 312 worker bees in the hive!\n\nAnswer: <answer>312</answer>",

So, the total number of students is:\n\n40 classes x 25 students/class = 1000 students\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of teachers. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:\n\n40 classes x 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of trees planted. Each student plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. So, the total number of trees planted is:\n\n1000 students x 1 tree/student = 1000 trees\n120 teachers x 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees\n\nAdding the number of trees planted by students and teachers, we get:\n\n1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees\n\nSo, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>1240</answer>",

Since each rock costs $5, we can divide $100 by $5 to get the number of rocks he can buy. $100 / $5 = 20 rocks.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much money Adam will make from selling the rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, we can multiply the number of rocks he sells by $7 to get the total amount of money he makes. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we can multiply 20 rocks by 0.6 to get the number of rocks he sells. 20 x 0.6 = 12 rocks.\n\nNow, we can find out how much money Adam makes from selling the rocks. 12 rocks x $7 = $84.\n\nFinally, we can find out how much money Adam loses. He spends $100 to buy the rocks, but he only makes $84 from selling them. So, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>$16</answer>.",

He rode 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, in four weeks, he rode 5 x 4 = 20 times. Each time he rode 25 kilometers, so in total he rode 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many kilometers Michael rode in the next three weeks. He rode 2 times a week, and each time he rode 60 kilometers. So, in three weeks, he rode 2 x 3 = 6 times. Each time he rode 60 kilometers, so in total he rode 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers.\n\nNow, we need to add the total kilometers Michael rode in both periods. He rode 500 kilometers in the first four weeks and 360 kilometers in the next three weeks. So, in total, he rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>860</answer>",

Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, the cost of the printer is $x - $400.\n\nThe total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 2m + (x - 400) = 2400\n\nwhere m is the cost of one monitor.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x + 2m = 2800\n\nSince the computer cost $1,100, we know that x = 1100. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n2200 + 2m = 2800\n\nSubtracting 2200 from both sides, we get:\n\n2m = 600\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nm = 300\n\nSo, one monitor cost $300.\n\nThe answer is: <answer>300</answer>",

Then, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.\n\nWe know that the total number of students who suggested adding either mashed potatoes or bacon is 182. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 166) = 182\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 166 = 182\n\nSubtract 166 from both sides:\n\n2x = 16\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. Since 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is:\n\nx + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174\n\nSo, 174 students suggested adding bacon.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>174</answer>",

Since 36 pickers can fill 8 drums of grapes daily, we can divide 8 by 36 to get the number of drums each picker can fill in a day:\n\n8 \u00f7 36 = 0.22 drums per picker per day\n\nSince there are 240 drums of grapes to fill, we can divide 240 by the number of drums each picker can fill in a day to find out how many days it will take to fill the drums:\n\n240 \u00f7 0.22 = 1090.91 days\n\nSo, it will take approximately 1091 days to fill 240 drums of grapes.\n\nHere's the answer wrapped up in the required format:\n\n<answer>1091</answer>",

                        "content": "Let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find the difference in the number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday. So, 19 - 18 = 1. This means Julia played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of hours Julia spent playing tag on both days. We know that she spent a total of 38 hours, and we know that she spent the same number of hours on both days. So, we can divide the total number of hours by 2 to find the number of hours she spent on each day. 38 / 2 = 19.\n\nFinally, we can multiply the number of hours Julia spent on each day by the number of kids she played with on each day to find the total number of hours she spent playing tag with each kid. So, 19 hours x 19 kids = 361 hours, and 19 hours x 18 kids = 342 hours. This means that Julia spent a total of 361 + 342 = 703 hours playing tag with all the kids.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>1</answer>.",

So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (8 - x) = 10\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx + 8 - x = 10\n\nSimplify:\n\n8 = 10\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n0 = 2\n\nThis doesn't make sense, so there must be an error in the question. Let's try again!\n\nLet's say Mary already put in y cups of flour. Then, she needs 3 + 5 = 8 cups of flour in total. So, we can set up the equation:\n\ny + 8 = 10\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\ny = 2\n\nSo, Mary put in 2 cups of flour.",

Let's call the number of chocolate bars he bought \"x\". Then, we can write the equation:\n\n3x = ?\n\nSince Dan has $5, we know that the total amount he spent on chocolate bars and candy bars is $5. We can write the equation:\n\n3x + 2y = 5\n\nwhere y is the number of candy bars he bought. We can simplify the equation by subtracting 2y from both sides:\n\n3x = 5 - 2y\n\nNow, we can solve for x. Since each chocolate bar costs $3, we know that x must be an integer. Let's try x = 1. Then, we can substitute x = 1 into the equation:\n\n3(1) = 5 - 2y\n\n3 = 5 - 2y\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives us:\n\n0 = 2y - 2\n\nAdding 2 to both sides gives us:\n\n2 = 2y\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n1 = y\n\nSo, Dan bought 1 candy bar.

Since the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we can set up an equation:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n360 = 3 x Width\n\nTo solve for Width, we can divide both sides by 3:\n\nWidth = 360 / 3\nWidth = 120\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the perimeter. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the rectangle. Since the length is 3 yards, the width is 120 feet, and the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 x (Length + Width)\n= 2 x (3 + 120)\n= 2 x 123\n= 246\n\nSo, the perimeter of the room is 246 feet.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>246</answer>",

Since he's building snowballs for 60 snowballs, we need to find out how many hours it will take him to build 60 snowballs.\n\n60 snowballs / 20 snowballs per hour = 3 hours\n\nNow, we need to account for the 2 snowballs that melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 60 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many times the snowballs melt in an hour:\n\n60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 times\n\nSo, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times. To find out how many snowballs melt in 3 hours, we can multiply the number of times they melt in 1 hour by 3:\n\n4 times per hour x 3 hours = 12 times\n\nSince Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, he builds 20 x 3 = 60 snowballs in 3 hours. However, 12 snowballs melt in 3 hours, so he will have 60 - 12 = 48 snowballs left.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to wrap it up inside the answer tags:\n\n<answer>3 hours</answer>",

Since the younger kid is 4 years younger, the age difference is 12 - 4 = 8 years.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find the number of packs needed.\n\nLet's assume the 12-year-old kid needs x candles and the 8-year-old kid needs y candles. Since the total number of candles needed is the sum of x and y, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + y = 16\n\nSince the 12-year-old kid needs more candles, we can assume x is greater than y. Let's say x = 10 and y = 6. This means the 12-year-old kid needs 10 candles and the 8-year-old kid needs 6 candles.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of candles needed:\n\nx + y = 10 + 6 = 16\n\nSince each pack of 5 candles costs $3, we can divide the total number of candles needed by 5 to find the number of packs needed:\n\n16 \u00f7 5 = 3.2\n\nSince we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost of the candles:\n\n4 packs x $3 per pack = $12\n\nSo, James will spend $12 on candles for his kids' birthday.",

Since it has 3 dozen seeds, we can convert this to a numerical value by multiplying 3 by 12 (since there are 12 seeds in a dozen). This gives us 36 seeds.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of seeds in the large sunflower. Since it has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower, we can multiply the number of seeds in the small sunflower by 1.5 (since 50% is the same as 1.5 times). This gives us 54 seeds.\n\nFinally, we can add the number of seeds in both sunflowers to find the total number of seeds. This gives us 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.\n\nSo, the answer is: <answer>90</answer>",

Next, we need to find out how many students left the building through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, we can calculate this by multiplying the remaining students (1000 - 300 = 700) by 3/5, which gives us 420 students.\n3. Finally, we can calculate how many students left the building through exit C by subtracting the number of students who left through exits A and B from the total number of students.

We can multiply the cost of one bottle of soda by 3 to get the total cost of 3 bottles of soda:\n\n$3.00 per bottle of soda \u00d7 3 = $9.00\n\nWe can also multiply the cost of one bottle of water by 2 to get the total cost of 2 bottles of water:\n\n$2.00 per bottle of water \u00d7 2 = $4.00\n\nFinally, we can add the total cost of the soda and water to get the total cost:\n\n$9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00\n\nSo, the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.\n\nHere's the answer:\n\n<answer>$13.00</answer>",
